{"name":"libmetis5","description":"Serial Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix Ordering\n METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs, partitioning finite\n element meshes, and producing fill reducing orderings for sparse matrices.\n The algorithms implemented in METIS are based on the multilevel\n recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint partitioning\n schemes.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
