{"name":"mtr-tiny","description":"Full screen ncurses traceroute tool\n mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs\n in a single network diagnostic tool.\n .\n As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host\n mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it\n determines the address of each network hop between the machines,\n it sends a sequence of ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the\n quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints\n running statistics about each machine.\n .\n mtr-tiny is compiled without support for X and conserves disk space.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libncurses5","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtinfo5","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["mtr","suidmanager"]}
