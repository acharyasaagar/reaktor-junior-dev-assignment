{"name":"libdouble-conversion1","description":"routines to convert IEEE floats to and from strings\n This library provides routines to convert IEEE single and double floats to and\n from string representations. It offers at lot of flexibility with respect to\n the conversion format: shortest, fixed, precision or exponential\n representation; decimal, octal or hexadecimal basis; control over number of\n digits, leading/trailing zeros and spaces.\n .\n The library consists of efficient conversion routines that have been\n extracted from the V8 JavaScript engine. The code has been refactored\n and improved so that it can be used more easily in other projects.\n .\n This package contains a shared version of the library.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libstdc++6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libdouble-conversion1v5"]}
