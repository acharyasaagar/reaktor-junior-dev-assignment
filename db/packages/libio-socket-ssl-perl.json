{"name":"libio-socket-ssl-perl","description":"Perl module implementing object oriented interface to SSL sockets\n This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that\n uses SSL to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server\n or client.  IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one\n needs to write a full-featured SSL client or server application:\n multiple SSL contexts, cipher selection, certificate verification, and\n SSL version selection.  As an extra bonus, it works perfectly with\n mod_perl.\n .\n IO::Socket::SSL uses IPv6 if libio-socket-ip-perl (>= 0.20) or\n libio-socket-inet6-perl is installed.","dependencies":[{"name":"libnet-ssleay-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libssl1.1","alternates":[]},{"name":"netbase","alternates":[]},{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libwww-perl"]}
