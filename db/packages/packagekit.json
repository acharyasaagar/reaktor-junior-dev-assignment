PackageKit is not meant to replace\n advanced tools like Synaptic.\n .\n The main benefits are:\n  - unified interface on several distributions\n  - fine grained privileges by using PolicyKit\n  - independency from a running desktop session during the processing","dependencies":[{"name":"libglib2.0-bin","alternates":[]},{"name":"policykit-1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libappstream4","alternates":[]},{"name":"libapt-inst2.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libapt-pkg5.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcc1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgstreamer1.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpackagekit-glib2-18","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpolkit-gobject-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsqlite3-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libstdc++6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libpackagekit-glib2-14","libpackagekit-qt2-2","packagekit-backend-apt","packagekit-backend-aptcc","packagekit-backend-smart","packagekit-offline-update","packagekit-plugin-click"]}
