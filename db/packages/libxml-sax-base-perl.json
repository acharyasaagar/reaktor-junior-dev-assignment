{"name":"libxml-sax-base-perl","description":"base class for SAX drivers and filters\n XML::SAX::Base is a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.  The main\n advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of events the right way (ie\n it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that\n method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass\n along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might\n nevertheless be interested in them.\n .\n This package also provides XML::SAX::Exception.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libxml-sax-perl"]}
