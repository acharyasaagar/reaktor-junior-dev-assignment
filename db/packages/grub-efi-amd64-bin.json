{"name":"grub-efi-amd64-bin","description":"GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (EFI-AMD64 binaries)\n GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a\n cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:\n .\n  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.\n  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.\n  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB\n    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking\n    update-grub.\n .\n This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with\n EFI-AMD64 architecture, such as the one provided by Intel Macs (that is, unless\n a BIOS interface has been activated).  It will not automatically install\n GRUB as the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg\n on upgrade, so most people should install grub-efi-amd64 instead.","dependencies":[{"name":"grub-common","alternates":[]},{"name":"efibootmgr","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
