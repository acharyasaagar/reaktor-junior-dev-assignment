{"name":"network-manager","description":"network management framework (daemon and userspace tools)\n NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices\n and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when\n available. It manages ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE\n devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN\n services.\n .\n This package provides the userspace daemons and a command line interface to\n interact with NetworkManager.\n .\n Optional dependencies:\n  * avahi-autoipd: Used for IPv4LL, a protocol for automatic Link-Local IP\n    address configuration.\n  * ppp: Required for establishing dial-up connections (e.g. via GSM).\n  * dnsmasq-base/iptables: Required for creating Ad-hoc connections and\n    connection sharing.\n  * libteam-utils: Network Team driver allows multiple network interfaces to be\n    teamed together and act like a single one. This process is called \"ethernet\n    bonding\", \"channel teaming\" or \"link aggregation\".","dependencies":[{"name":"libaudit1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libbluetooth3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcurl3-gnutls","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgnutls30","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjansson4","alternates":[]},{"name":"libmm-glib0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libndp0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnewt0.52","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnl-3-200","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnm0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpolkit-agent-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpolkit-gobject-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpsl5","alternates":[]},{"name":"libreadline7","alternates":[]},{"name":"libselinux1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libteamdctl0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libudev1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libuuid1","alternates":[]},{"name":"lsb-base","alternates":[]},{"name":"wpasupplicant","alternates":[]},{"name":"dbus","alternates":[]},{"name":"udev","alternates":[]},{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]},{"name":"isc-dhcp-client","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpam-systemd","alternates":[]},{"name":"policykit-1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["ppp","ppp"]}
