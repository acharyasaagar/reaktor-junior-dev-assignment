{"name":"libbrotli1","description":"library implementing brotli encoder and decoder (shared libraries)\n Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm\n that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant\n of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling,\n with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available\n general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with\n deflate but offers more dense compression.\n .\n This package installs shared libraries.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
