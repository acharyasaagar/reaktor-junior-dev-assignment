{"name":"libhttp-cookies-perl","description":"HTTP cookie jars\n This class is for objects that represent a \"cookie jar\" -- that is, a\n database of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows\n about.\n .\n Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both\n store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more\n information about cookies refer to\n <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and\n <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new\n style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed\n to be able to coexist happily.\n .\n Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of\n Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to\n initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a\n HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libhttp-date-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libhttp-message-perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libwww-perl"]}
