{"name":"libsoup2.4-1","description":"HTTP library implementation in C -- Shared library\n It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\n implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been\n split into separate packages.\n .\n libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+\n applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers\n on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to\n the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also\n supported for those who want it).\n .\n Features:\n  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs\n  * Automatically caches connections\n  * SSL Support using GnuTLS\n  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling\n  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication\n  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication\n  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support\n .\n This package contains the shared library.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgssapi-krb5-2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsqlite3-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxml2","alternates":[]},{"name":"glib-networking","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
