{"name":"libsmbios-c2","description":"Provide access to (SM)BIOS information -- dynamic library\n libsmbios aims towards providing access to as much BIOS information as\n possible. It does this by providing a library of functions that can be used\n as well as sample binaries.\n .\n It incorporates extensible access to SMBIOS information capabilities and\n ability to perform unit tests across multiple systems without using physical\n hardware. Moreover, centralized, data-driven exception handling for broken\n BIOS tables is provided. Currently, full access to the SMBIOS table and its\n items is implemented. Additionally, access and manipulation of Dell Indexed\n IO Token (type 0xD4) is implemented. This token is a vendor-extention\n SMBIOS structure which allows uniform access to manipulate the system CMOS\n to enable, disable, or otherwise manipulate normal BIOS functions or features.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
