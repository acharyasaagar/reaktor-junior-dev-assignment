{"name":"python3-cryptography","description":"Python library exposing cryptographic recipes and primitives (Python 3)\n The cryptography library is designed to be a \"one-stop-shop\" for\n all your cryptographic needs in Python.\n .\n As an alternative to the libraries that came before it, cryptography\n tries to address some of the issues with those libraries:\n  - Lack of PyPy and Python 3 support.\n  - Lack of maintenance.\n  - Use of poor implementations of algorithms (i.e. ones with known\n    side-channel attacks).\n  - Lack of high level, \"Cryptography for humans\", APIs.\n  - Absence of algorithms such as AES-GCM.\n  - Poor introspectability, and thus poor testability.\n  - Extremely error prone APIs, and bad defaults.\n .\n This package contains the Python 3 version of cryptography.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-asn1crypto","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-cffi-backend-api-min","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-cffi-backend-api-max","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-idna","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-six","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3:any","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libssl1.1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["python3-openssl"]}
