{"name":"lintian","description":"Debian package checker\n Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy\n violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian\n policy as well as some checks for common errors.\n .\n It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores\n information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this\n information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating\n expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the\n complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.\n .\n This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian\n packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer\n should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the\n archive.\n .\n This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 4.1.4.","dependencies":[{"name":"binutils","alternates":[]},{"name":"bzip2","alternates":[]},{"name":"diffstat","alternates":[]},{"name":"dpkg","alternates":[]},{"name":"file","alternates":[]},{"name":"gettext","alternates":[]},{"name":"intltool-debian","alternates":[]},{"name":"libapt-pkg-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libarchive-zip-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libclass-accessor-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libclone-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdigest-sha-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdpkg-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libemail-valid-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfile-basedir-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libipc-run-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"liblist-moreutils-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libparse-debianchangelog-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtext-levenshtein-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtimedate-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"liburi-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libyaml-libyaml-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxml-simple-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"man-db","alternates":[]},{"name":"patchutils","alternates":[]},{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"t1utils","alternates":[]},{"name":"xz-utils","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["funny-manpages","pkg-perl-tools"]}
