{"name":"gnome-session-bin","description":"GNOME Session Manager - Minimal runtime\n The GNOME Session Manager is in charge of starting the core components\n of the GNOME desktop, and applications that should be launched at\n login time. It also features a way to save and restore currently\n running applications.\n .\n This package contains the binaries for the GNOME Session Manager, but\n no startup scripts. It is meant for those willing to start\n gnome-session by hand with the components of their choice, and for\n applications such as GDM that use gnome-session internally.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libegl1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libepoxy0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgl1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgles2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgnome-desktop-3-17","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgtk-3-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libice6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjson-glib-1.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsm6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcomposite1","alternates":[]},{"name":"dconf-gsettings-backend","alternates":["gsettings-backend"]},{"name":"dbus-x11","alternates":[]},{"name":"gsettings-desktop-schemas","alternates":[]},{"name":"upower","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["gdm3"],"notes":["a note being created for this package"],"tags":["ha","ooo"]}
