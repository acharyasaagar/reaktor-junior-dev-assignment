It provides aggressive\n parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting\n services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using\n Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an\n elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.\n .\n systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a\n drop-in replacement for sysvinit.\n .\n Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you\n boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.","dependencies":[{"name":"libapparmor1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libaudit1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcryptsetup12","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgpg-error0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libkmod2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libmount1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpam0g","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]},{"name":"util-linux","alternates":[]},{"name":"mount","alternates":[]},{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]},{"name":"procps","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["apparmor","ifupdown","laptop-mode-tools","systemd-shim","udev"]}
