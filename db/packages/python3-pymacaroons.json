{"name":"python3-pymacaroons","description":"Macaroon library for Python 3\n Macaroons, like cookies, are a form of bearer credential.  Unlike opaque\n tokens, macaroons embed caveats that define specific authorization\n requirements for the target service, the service that issued the root\n macaroon and which is capable of verifying the integrity of macaroons it\n receives.\n .\n Macaroons allow for delegation and attenuation of authorization.  They are\n simple and fast to verify, and decouple authorization policy from the\n enforcement of that policy.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3-nacl","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-six","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3:any","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
