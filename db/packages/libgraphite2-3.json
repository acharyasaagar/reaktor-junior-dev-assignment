{"name":"libgraphite2-3","description":"Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library\n Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use \"smart fonts\" capable\n of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:\n contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,\n stacking diacritics and complex positioning.\n .\n This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script\n Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to\n other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local\n extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number\n of \"minority language\" communities for local extensibility of complex script\n behaviors.\n .\n The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified\n through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by\n compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using\n grcompiler.\n .\n This package contains the shared library.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libgraphite2-2.0.0"]}
