{"name":"libcairo-perl","description":"Perl interface to the Cairo graphics library\n libcairo-perl provides access to the Cairo library.\n .\n Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple\n output devices. It is designed to produce consistent output\n on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware\n acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).\n .\n The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing\n operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including\n stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing\n translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing\n operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale,\n rotation, shear, etc.)\n .\n Find out more about Cairo at http://www.cairographics.org/.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perlapi-5.26.1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcairo2","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
