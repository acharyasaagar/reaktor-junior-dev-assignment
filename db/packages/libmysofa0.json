{"name":"libmysofa0","description":"library to read HRTFs stored in the AES69-2015 SOFA format\n libmysofa is a light weight C-library intended to read SOFA (Spatially Oriented\n Format for Acoustics) files for spatial rendering.\n It hardly has any library dependencies and is suitable for embedded devices.\n .\n It reads SOFA files and checks whether the data complies to the\n \"SimpleFreeFieldHRIR\" conventions. In addition, it provides functions to\n look-up and interpolate the filters for a given orientation and to normalize\n the HRTFs (Head-Related Transfer Functions) to a reference level.\n .\n This package contains the shared objects necessary to run an application using\n libmysofa.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"zlib1g","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
