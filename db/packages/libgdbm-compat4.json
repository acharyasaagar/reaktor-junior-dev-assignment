{"name":"libgdbm-compat4","description":"GNU dbm database routines (legacy support runtime version) \n GNU dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible\n hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.\n .\n The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus\n providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type\n ('hash' to perl programmers).\n .\n This package includes library files, required to run old programs,\n that use legacy 'dbm' interface. For new programs, please use modern\n interface, provided by libgdbm5 and libgdbm-dev.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgdbm5","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
