{"name":"perl-openssl-defaults","description":"version compatibility baseline for Perl OpenSSL packages\n A subset of Perl XS module packages expose the OpenSSL binary interface\n to Perl code. This can lead to incompatibilities if these packages are\n linked against different versions of OpenSSL.\n .\n This package provides a virtual package \"perl-openssl-abi-x\" that\n corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.\n The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend\n on this.\n .\n Tools are also provided for generating this dependency with minimum\n hassle.
