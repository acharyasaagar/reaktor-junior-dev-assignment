{"name":"python3-keyrings.alt","description":"alternate backend implementations for python3-keyring\n The Python keyring library provides an easy way to access the system keyring\n service from Python. It can be used in any application that needs safe\n password storage.\n .\n Keyrings.alt module contains the alternate keyring backend implementations\n for use with python-keyring, most importantly the file backend which does\n not need any external services to work.\n .\n Keyrings in this package may have security risks or other implications.\n These backends were extracted from the main keyring project to make them\n available for those who wish to employ them, but are discouraged for general\n production use. Include this module and use its backends at your own risk.\n .\n This package contains the Python 3 version of keyrings.alt.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3-crypto","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-six","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3:any","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
