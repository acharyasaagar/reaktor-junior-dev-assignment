{"name":"libhttp-daemon-perl","description":"simple http server class\n Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a\n socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of\n IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.\n .\n The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.\n The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is\n another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this\n object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The\n ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.\n .\n This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of\n the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note\n that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the\n HTTP/1.1 protocol.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libhttp-date-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libhttp-message-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"liblwp-mediatypes-perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libwww-perl"]}
