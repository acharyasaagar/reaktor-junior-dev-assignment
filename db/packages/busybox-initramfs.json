{"name":"busybox-initramfs","description":"Standalone shell setup for initramfs\n BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single\n small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common\n utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,\n mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than\n their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included\n provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU\n counterparts.\n .\n busybox-initramfs provides a simple stand alone shell that provides\n only the basic utilities needed for the initramfs.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
