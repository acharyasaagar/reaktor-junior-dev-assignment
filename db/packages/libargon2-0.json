{"name":"libargon2-0","description":"memory-hard hashing function - runtime library\n Argon2 is a password-hashing function that can be used to hash passwords\n for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.\n .\n There are two main versions of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d.\n Argon2i is the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides\n the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.\n .\n Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:\n  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and\n    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations\n  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes\n  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads\n .\n This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
