{"name":"libmagickcore-6.q16-3","description":"low-level image manipulation library -- quantum depth Q16\n The MagickCore API is a low-level interface between the C programming language\n and the ImageMagick image processing libraries and is recommended for\n wizard-level programmers only. Unlike the MagickWand C API which uses only a\n few opaque types and accessors, with MagickCore you almost exclusively access\n the structure members directly.\n .\n This package contains the C libraries needed to run executables that make\n use of MagickCore.\n .\n This version of libmagickcore is compiled for a channel\n depth of 16 bits (Q16).","dependencies":[{"name":"libbz2-1.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfftw3-double3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfontconfig1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfreetype6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcc1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgomp1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjbig0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjpeg8","alternates":[]},{"name":"liblcms2-2","alternates":[]},{"name":"liblqr-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libltdl7","alternates":[]},{"name":"liblzma5","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpng16-16","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtiff5","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxext6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxml2","alternates":[]},{"name":"zlib1g","alternates":[]},{"name":"imagemagick-6-common","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
