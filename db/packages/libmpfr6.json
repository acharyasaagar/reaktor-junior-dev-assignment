{"name":"libmpfr6","description":"multiple precision floating-point computation\n MPFR provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation\n with correct rounding.  The computation is both efficient and has a\n well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the\n ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic\n (53-bit mantissa).","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgmp10","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libgmp3","libmpc3"]}
