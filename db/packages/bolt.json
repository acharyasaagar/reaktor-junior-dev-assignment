{"name":"bolt","description":"system daemon to manage thunderbolt 3 devices\n Thunderbolt 3 features different security modes that require\n devices to be authorized before they can be used. The D-Bus API can be\n used to list devices, enroll them (authorize and store them in the\n local database) and forget them again (remove previously enrolled\n devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or\n removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically\n authorized as soon as they are connected.  A command line tool, called\n boltctl, can be used to control the daemon and perform all the above\n mentioned tasks.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpolkit-gobject-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libudev1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
