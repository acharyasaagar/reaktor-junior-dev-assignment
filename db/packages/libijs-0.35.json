{"name":"libijs-0.35","description":"IJS raster image transport protocol: shared library\n IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page\n images. This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the protocol,\n the design of which is still in flux. When the protocol specification is\n published, it will be authoritative. Applications should feel free to link\n against the library provided in this package, adapt that code for their own\n needs, or roll a completely new implementation.\n .\n IJS is a client-server protocol, used to write ghostscript drivers. The\n drivers are separate programs. The client and server communicate via pipes,\n though shared memory may be used additionally in the future. Currently IJS\n is used by the hpijs and ijsgimpprint drivers.\n .\n Code for both the client- and server-side is included in the library. This\n package provides the shared library.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
