{"name":"libboost-system1.65.1","description":"Operating system (e.g. diagnostics support) library\n This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.\n .\n The Boost System library provides simple, light-weight error_code\n objects that encapsulate system-specific error code values, yet also\n provide access to more abstract and portable error conditions via\n error_condition objects. Because error_code objects can represent\n errors from sources other than the operating system, including\n user-defined sources, each error_code and error_condition has an\n associated error_category.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libstdc++6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
