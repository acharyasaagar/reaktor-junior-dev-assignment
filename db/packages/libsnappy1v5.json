{"name":"libsnappy1v5","description":"fast compression/decompression library\n Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for\n maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression\n library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable\n compression.\n .\n For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy\n is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting\n compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core\n of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250\n MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcc1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libstdc++6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
