{"name":"libmpc3","description":"multiple precision complex floating-point library\n MPC is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision\n arithmetic on complex numbers providing correct rounding. For the time\n being, it contains all arithmetic operations over complex numbers, the\n exponential and the logarithm functions, the trigonometric and\n hyperbolic functions.\n .\n Ultimately, it should implement a multiprecision equivalent of the ISO\n C99 standard.\n .\n It builds upon the GNU MP and the MPFR libraries.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgmp10","alternates":[]},{"name":"libmpfr6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
