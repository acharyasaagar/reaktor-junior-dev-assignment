{"name":"libcairo2","description":"Cairo 2D vector graphics library\n Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased\n vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist\n of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width\n with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with\n optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the\n extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render\n Extension.\n .\n Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path\n construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the\n significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When\n complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of\n PDF 1.4.\n .\n This package contains the shared libraries.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfontconfig1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfreetype6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpixman-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpng16-16","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-render0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-shm0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxext6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxrender1","alternates":[]},{"name":"zlib1g","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libwebkit2gtk-3.0-25","libwebkitgtk-1.0-0","libwebkitgtk-3.0-0","weston"]}
