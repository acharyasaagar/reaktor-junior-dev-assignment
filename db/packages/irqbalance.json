{"name":"irqbalance","description":"Daemon to balance interrupts for SMP systems\n Daemon to balance interrupts across multiple CPUs, which can lead to\n better performance and IO balance on SMP systems. This package is\n especially useful on systems with multi-core processors, as interrupts\n will typically only be serviced by the first core.\n .\n Note: irqbalance is not useful if you don't have more than one core\n       or socket.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcap-ng0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libncurses5","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnuma1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtinfo5","alternates":[]},{"name":"debconf","alternates":["debconf-2.0"]},{"name":"lsb-base","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
