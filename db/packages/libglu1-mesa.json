{"name":"libglu1-mesa","description":"Mesa OpenGL utility library (GLU)\n GLU offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; checking for the\n presence of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which follow\n the same conventions for advertising extensions); drawing\n piecewise-linear curves, NURBS, quadrics and other primitives\n (including, but not limited to, teapots); tesselating surfaces; setting\n up projection matrices and unprojecting screen coordinates to world\n coordinates.\n .\n On Linux, this library is also known as libGLU or libGLU.so.1.\n .\n This package provides the SGI implementation of GLU provided by the\n Mesa project (ergo the \"-mesa\" suffix).","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcc1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgl1-mesa-glx","alternates":["libgl1"]},{"name":"libstdc++6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
