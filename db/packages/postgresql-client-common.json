It provides a wrapper which selects the right version\n for the particular cluster you want to access (with a command line\n option, an environment variable, /etc/postgresql-common/user_clusters,\n or ~/.postgresqlrc).\n .\n PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management\n system. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed\n to be extensible by users in many aspects. Its features include ACID\n transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries, triggers,\n outer joins, multiversion concurrency control, and user-defined types\n and functions.","dependencies":[{"name":"netbase","alternates":[]},{"name":"pgdg-keyring","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
