{"name":"libhpmud0","description":"HP Multi-Point Transport Driver (hpmud) run-time libraries\n The HP Linux Printing and Imaging System provides full support for\n printing on most HP SFP (single function peripheral) inkjets and many\n LaserJets, and for scanning, sending faxes and for photo-card access on\n most HP MFP (multi-function peripheral) printers.\n .\n Shared library that provides direct I/O for each process. Prior to\n hpmud, all I/O was serialized through hpiod, a monolithic I/O processor.\n The new hpmud direct I/O is faster. Hpmud supports parallel, USB and\n JetDirect connectivity.\n .\n With hpmud, HPLIP no longer has Linux specific libusb extensions. This\n means any UNIX/Linux derivative that supports libusb may work with\n HPLIP. A public HPLIP \"C\" API is exposed through hpmud. See hpmud.h\n for documentation. A Python wrapper for hpmud, called hpmudext, is also\n available.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsnmp30","alternates":[]},{"name":"libusb-1.0-0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
