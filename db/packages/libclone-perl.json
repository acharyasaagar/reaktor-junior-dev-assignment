{"name":"libclone-perl","description":"module for recursively copying Perl datatypes\n The Clone module provides a clone() method which makes recursive copies of\n nested hash, array, scalar and reference types, including tied variables and\n objects.\n .\n It is faster (although less flexible) than Storable's dclone. Its\n functionality is _not_ serializing in-memory objects (i.e. as\n Data::Dumper or YAML::Dump do), but deep-copying them over to new\n in-memory structures.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perlapi-5.26.1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
