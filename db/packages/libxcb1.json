XCB provides several advantages over\n Xlib:\n .\n  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint\n  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later\n  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol\n  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking\n  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from\n    machine-parsable protocol descriptions","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxau6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxdmcp6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["alsa-utils"]}
