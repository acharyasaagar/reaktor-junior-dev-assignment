{"name":"libdata-dump-perl","description":"Perl module to help dump data structures\n Data::Dump provides a single function called dump that takes a list of values\n as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl\n code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments. The\n string is formatted for easy reading.\n .\n If called in void context, the dump is printed on standard error instead of\n being returned. If you don't like importing a function that overrides Perl's\n not-so-useful builtin, then you can also import the same function as \"pp\"\n (the mnemonic for \"pretty-print\").","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
