{"name":"dirmngr","description":"GNU privacy guard - network certificate management service\n dirmngr is a server for managing and downloading OpenPGP and X.509\n certificates, as well as updates and status signals related to those\n certificates.  For OpenPGP, this means pulling from the public\n HKP/HKPS keyservers, or from LDAP servers.  For X.509 this includes\n Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status\n Protocol updates (OCSP).  It is capable of using tor for network\n access.\n .\n dirmngr is used for network access by gpg, gpgsm, and dirmngr-client,\n among other tools.  Unless this package is installed, the parts of\n the GnuPG suite that try to interact with the network will fail.","dependencies":[{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]},{"name":"gpgconf","alternates":[]},{"name":"lsb-base","alternates":[]},{"name":"libassuan0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcrypt20","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgnutls30","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgpg-error0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libksba8","alternates":[]},{"name":"libldap-2.4-2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnpth0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["gnupg2"]}
