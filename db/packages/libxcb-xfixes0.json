{"name":"libxcb-xfixes0","description":"X C Binding, xfixes extension\n This package contains the library files needed to run software using\n libxcb-xfixes, the xfixes extension for the X C Binding.\n .\n The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,\n designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over\n Xlib:\n .\n  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint\n  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later\n  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol\n  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking\n  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from\n    machine-parsable protocol descriptions","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
