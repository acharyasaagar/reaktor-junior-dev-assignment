{"name":"cups-browsed","description":"OpenPrinting CUPS Filters - cups-browsed\n This package provides cups-browsed, a daemon which browses the Bonjour\n broadcasts of shared remote CUPS printers and makes the printers\n available locally, replacing the CUPS broadcasting/browsing which was\n dropped in CUPS 1.6.x. This way the old behavior of having the remote\n printers available automatically is now re-implemented with Bonjour.\n .\n cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 client to allow the\n latter to browse the printer list of CUPS < 1.6 servers (by using the\n old 'cups' protocol in BrowseRemoteProtocols).\n .\n cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 server to allow CUPS <\n 1.6 clients to browse its printer list (by using the old 'cups'\n protocol in BrowseLocalProtocols).","dependencies":[{"name":"libavahi-client3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libavahi-common3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libavahi-glib1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcups2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcupsfilters1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libldap-2.4-2","alternates":[]},{"name":"cups-daemon","alternates":[]},{"name":"lsb-base","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["cups-daemon","cups-filters"]}
