{"name":"memtest86+","description":"thorough real-mode memory tester\n Memtest86+ scans your RAM for errors.\n .\n This tester runs independently of any OS - it is run at computer\n boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to\n look at `memtester', which allows to test your memory within Linux,\n but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.\n .\n It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel\n patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.\n .\n Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent\n hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,\n including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.\n .\n Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel.","dependencies":[{"name":"debconf","alternates":["debconf-2.0"]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
