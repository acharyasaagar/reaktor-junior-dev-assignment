{"name":"libccolamd2","description":"constrained column approximate library for sparse matrices\n Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving\n sparse matrices.\n .\n The CCOLAMD library implements the \"Constrained COLumn Approximate Minimum\n Degree ordering\" algorithm. It computes a permutation vector P such that the\n LU factorization of A (:,P) tends to be sparser than that of A.
