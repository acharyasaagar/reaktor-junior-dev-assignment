{"name":"libpcap0.8","description":"system interface for user-level packet capture\n libpcap (Packet CAPture) provides a portable framework for low-level\n network monitoring.  Applications include network statistics collection,\n security monitoring, network debugging, etc.\n .\n Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for\n packet capture, and since there are several tools that require this\n functionality, the libpcap authors created this system-independent API\n to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for several\n system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
