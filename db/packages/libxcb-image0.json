{"name":"libxcb-image0","description":"utility libraries for X C Binding -- image\n This package contains the library files needed to run software using\n libxcb-image, providing port of Xlib's XImage and XShmImage functions.\n .\n The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of\n libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension\n libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions\n and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the\n libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of\n the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-shm0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-util1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
