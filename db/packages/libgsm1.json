{"name":"libgsm1","description":"Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor\n This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an\n implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for\n full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP\n (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.\n .\n GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling\n rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility\n with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160\n 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).\n The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker\n recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable\n form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).\n .\n The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and\n a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime\n on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the\n ETSI standard test patterns.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
