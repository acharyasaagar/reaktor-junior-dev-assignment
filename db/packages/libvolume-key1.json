{"name":"libvolume-key1","description":"Library for manipulating storage encryption keys and passphrases\n This package provides libvolume_key, a library for manipulating storage volume\n encryption keys and storing them separately from volumes.\n .\n The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted\n hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key\n back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software\n failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the\n company data after an employee leaves abruptly.","dependencies":[{"name":"libblkid1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcryptsetup12","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgpgme11","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnspr4","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnss3","alternates":[]},{"name":"gnupg","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
