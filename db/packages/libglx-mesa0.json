{"name":"libglx-mesa0","description":"free implementation of the OpenGL API -- GLX vendor library\n Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to\n that of OpenGL.  To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command\n syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from\n Silicon Graphics, Inc.  However, the authors make no claim that Mesa\n is in any way a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with\n Silicon Graphics, Inc.\n .\n This version of Mesa provides GLX and DRI capabilities: it is capable of\n both direct and indirect rendering.  For direct rendering, it can use DRI\n modules from the libgl1-mesa-dri package to accelerate drawing.\n .\n This package does not include the modules themselves: these can be found\n in the libgl1-mesa-dri package.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdrm2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libexpat1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglapi-mesa","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-xcb1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-dri2-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-dri3-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-glx0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-present0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb-sync1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxdamage1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxext6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxfixes3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxshmfence1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxxf86vm1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgl1-mesa-dri","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["glx-diversions","libopengl-perl","nvidia-304","nvidia-340","nvidia-384"]}
