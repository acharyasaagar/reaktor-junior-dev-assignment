{"name":"liblist-moreutils-perl","description":"Perl module with additional list functions not found in List::Util\n List::MoreUtils provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on\n lists which is not going to go into List::Util.\n .\n All of the functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl\n code. Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better\n performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of\n these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this module\n could not be compiled on this machine.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perlapi-5.26.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libexporter-tiny-perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
