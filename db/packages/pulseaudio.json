{"name":"pulseaudio","description":"PulseAudio sound server\n PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and\n WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with\n much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.\n .\n These are some of PulseAudio's features:\n .\n   * High quality software mixing of multiple audio streams with support for\n     more than one sink/source. May be used to combine multiple sound cards\n     into one (with sample rate adjustment).\n .\n   * Wide range of supported client libraries. ESD, ALSA, oss, libao and\n     GStreamer client applications are supported as-is. Native PulseAudio\n     plug-ins are also available for xmms and mplayer.\n .\n   * Good low latency behaviour and very accurate latency measurement for\n     playback and recording. Ability to fully synchronize multiple playback\n     streams.\n .\n   * Network transparency, allowing an application to play back or record\n     audio on a different machine than the one it is running on.\n .\n   * Extensible plug-in architecture with plug-ins for jackd, multicast-rtp\n     lirc and avahi, just to name a few.\n .\n This package contains the daemon and basic module set.","dependencies":[{"name":"libapparmor1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libasound2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcap2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdbus-1-3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcc1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libice6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libltdl7","alternates":[]},{"name":"liborc-0.4-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpulse0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsm6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsnapd-glib1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsndfile1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libspeexdsp1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libstdc++6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtdb1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libudev1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libwebrtc-audio-processing1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-xcb1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxtst6","alternates":[]},{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]},{"name":"lsb-base","alternates":[]},{"name":"libasound2-plugins","alternates":[]},{"name":"pulseaudio-utils","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
