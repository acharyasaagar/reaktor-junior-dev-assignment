{"name":"docker-ce","description":"Docker: the open-source application container engine\n Docker is a product for you to build, ship and run any application as a\n lightweight container\n .\n Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means\n they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest cloud compute instance and\n everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular\n language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks\n for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without\n depending on a particular stack or provider.","dependencies":[{"name":"docker-ce-cli","alternates":[]},{"name":"containerd.io","alternates":[]},{"name":"iptables","alternates":[]},{"name":"libseccomp2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdevmapper1.02.1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
