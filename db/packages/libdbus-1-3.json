{"name":"libdbus-1-3","description":"simple interprocess messaging system (library)\n D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.\n Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in\n terms of complexity.\n .\n D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus\n decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be\n low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using\n XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but\n it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.\n .\n It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.\n .\n The daemon can be found in the dbus package.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsystemd0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["dbus"]}
