{"name":"read-edid","description":"hardware information-gathering tool for VESA PnP monitors\n read-edid consists of two tools:\n .\n get-edid uses a VESA VBE 2 interrupt service routine request to read\n a 128 byte EDID version 1 structure from your graphics card, which\n retrieves this information from the monitor via the Data Display\n Channel (DDC).\n .\n get-edid uses architecture-specific methods for querying the video\n hardware (real-mode x86 instructions on i386, Open Firmware device\n tree parsing on PowerMac) and is therefore only available for i386 and\n powerpc architectures.\n .\n parse-edid parses this data structure and outputs data suitable for\n inclusion into the XFree86 or X.org configuration file. It is available\n for any architecture.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx86-1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
