{"name":"printer-driver-splix","description":"Driver for Samsung and Xerox SPL2 and SPLc laser printers\n Support for printing to SPL2- and SPLc-based printers. These are most\n of the cheaper Samsung laser printers which do not understand standard\n languages like PostScript or PCL. Both monochrome (ML-15xx, ML-16xx,\n ML-17xx, ML-2xxx) and color (CLP-5xx, CLP-6xx) models are supported.\n Also some rebranded Samsungs like the Xerox Phaser 6100 work with this\n driver.\n .\n Note that older SPL1-based models (ML-12xx, ML-14xx) do not work. Use\n these printers with the older \"gdi\" driver which is built into\n GhostScript.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcups2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcupsimage2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcc1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjbig0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libstdc++6","alternates":[]},{"name":"cups","alternates":[]},{"name":"cups-client","alternates":[]},{"name":"cups-filters","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["splix"]}
