{"name":"libxcursor1","description":"X cursor management library\n Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the\n X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in\n several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using\n images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's\n CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is\n not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses\n the core X protocol CreateCursor request.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libx11-6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxfixes3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxrender1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
