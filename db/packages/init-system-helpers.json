{"name":"init-system-helpers","description":"helper tools for all init systems\n This package contains helper tools that are necessary for switching between\n the various init systems that Debian contains (e. g. sysvinit or\n systemd). An example is deb-systemd-helper, a script that enables systemd unit\n files without depending on a running systemd.\n .\n It also includes the \"service\", \"invoke-rc.d\", and \"update-rc.d\" scripts which\n provide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping\n services for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy.\n .\n While this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT\n specific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to\n include their helpers in this package.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl-base","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["systemd","sysvinit-utils"]}
