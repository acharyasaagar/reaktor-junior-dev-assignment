{"name":"shim","description":"boot loader to chain-load signed boot loaders under Secure Boot\n This package provides a minimalist boot loader which allows verifying\n signatures of other UEFI binaries against either the Secure Boot DB/DBX or\n against a built-in signature database.  Its purpose is to allow a small,\n infrequently-changing binary to be signed by the UEFI CA, while allowing\n an OS distributor to revision their main bootloader independently of the CA.","dependencies":[],"reverseDependencies":["shim-signed"]}
