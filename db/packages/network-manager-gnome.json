{"name":"network-manager-gnome","description":"network management framework (GNOME frontend)\n NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices\n and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when\n available. It manages ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE\n devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN\n services.\n .\n This package contains a systray applet for GNOME's notification area but it\n also works for other desktop environments which provide a systray like KDE\n or Xfce.\n It displays the available networks and allows users to easily switch between\n them. For encrypted networks it will prompt the user for the key/passphrase\n and it can optionally store them in the gnome-keyring.","dependencies":[{"name":"libappindicator3-1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libatk1.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcairo2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgtk-3-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjansson4","alternates":[]},{"name":"libmm-glib0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnm0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnma0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnotify4","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpango-1.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpangocairo-1.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsecret-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libselinux1","alternates":[]},{"name":"dconf-gsettings-backend","alternates":["gsettings-backend"]},{"name":"network-manager","alternates":[]},{"name":"policykit-1-gnome","alternates":["polkit-1-auth-agent"]},{"name":"default-dbus-session-bus","alternates":["dbus-session-bus"]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
