{"name":"liberror-perl","description":"Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way\n The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly \"Error\" provides a\n procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly \"Error\" is a base class\n for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can\n simply be recorded.\n .\n Errors in the class \"Error\" should not be thrown directly, but the user\n should throw errors from a sub-class of \"Error\".\n .\n Warning: Using the \"Error\" module is no longer recommended due to the\n black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its\n maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage\n people from doing so.\n .\n Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),\n Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny\n (libtry-tiny-perl).","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
