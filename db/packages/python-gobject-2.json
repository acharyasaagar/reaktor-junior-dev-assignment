{"name":"python-gobject-2","description":"deprecated static Python bindings for the GObject library\n GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object\n paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,\n the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.\n .\n This package contains the static Python bindings for gobject, glib, and gio.\n These are deprecated by dynamic gobject-introspection bindings (which are\n provided with the python-gobject package), and should not be used in newly\n written code. These static bindings just exist to provide backwards\n compatibility for GNOME 2 based software.","dependencies":[{"name":"python","alternates":[]},{"name":"python","alternates":[]},{"name":"python:any","alternates":[]},{"name":"python:any","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libffi6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["python-gobject"]}
