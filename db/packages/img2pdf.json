{"name":"img2pdf","description":"Lossless conversion of raster images to PDF\n This program will take a list of raster images and produce a PDF file with the\n images embedded in it. JPEG and JPEG2000 images will be included without\n recompression. Raster images in other formats will be included with zip/flate\n encoding which usually leads to an increase in the resulting size because\n formats like png compress better than PDF which just zip/flate compresses the\n RGB data. As a result, this tool is able to losslessly wrap images into a PDF\n container with a quality to filesize ratio that is typically better (in case\n of JPEG and JPEG2000 images) or equal (in case of other formats) than that of\n existing tools.\n .\n This package contains the executable.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3:any","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-img2pdf","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-pkg-resources","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
