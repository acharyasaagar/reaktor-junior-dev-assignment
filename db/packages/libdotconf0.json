{"name":"libdotconf0","description":"Configuration file parser library - runtime files\n dot.conf is a simple-to-use and powerful configuration-file parser\n library written in C. The configuration files created for dot.conf\n look very similar to those used by the Apache Webserver. Even\n Container-Directives known from httpd.conf can easily be used in the\n exact same manner as for Apache-Modules. It supports various types of\n arguments, dynamically loadable modules that create their own\n configuration options on-the-fly, a here-documents feature to pass\n very long ARG_STR data to your app, and on-the-fly inclusion of\n additional config files.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
