{"name":"shim-signed","description":"Secure Boot chain-loading bootloader (Microsoft-signed binary)\n This package provides a minimalist boot loader which allows verifying\n signatures of other UEFI binaries against either the Secure Boot DB/DBX or\n against a built-in signature database.  Its purpose is to allow a small,\n infrequently-changing binary to be signed by the UEFI CA, while allowing\n an OS distributor to revision their main bootloader independently of the CA.\n .\n This package contains the version of the bootloader binary signed by the\n Microsoft UEFI CA.","dependencies":[{"name":"debconf","alternates":["debconf-2.0"]},{"name":"shim","alternates":[]},{"name":"grub-efi-amd64-signed","alternates":[]},{"name":"grub2-common","alternates":[]},{"name":"mokutil","alternates":[]},{"name":"sbsigntool","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["grub-efi-amd64-signed"]}
