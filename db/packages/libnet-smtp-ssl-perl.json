{"name":"libnet-smtp-ssl-perl","description":"Perl module providing SSL support to Net::SMTP\n Net::SMTP::SSL implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL\n for its network operations. Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is\n not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps\n future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,\n and it's not a pain to specify that.\n .\n This package is deprecated. Net::SMTP (in perl core) has support for SMTP\n over SSL, and also for STARTTLS, since version 1.28 (included in Perl 5.22).","dependencies":[{"name":"libio-socket-ssl-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
