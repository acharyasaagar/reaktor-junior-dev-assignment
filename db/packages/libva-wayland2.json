{"name":"libva-wayland2","description":"Video Acceleration (VA) API for Linux -- Wayland runtime\n Video Acceleration API (VA API) is a library (\"libVA\") and API specification\n which enables and provides access to graphics hardware (GPU) acceleration for\n video processing on Linux and UNIX based operating systems. Accelerated\n processing includes video decoding, video encoding, subpicture blending and\n rendering. The specification was originally designed by Intel for its GMA\n (Graphics Media Accelerator) series of GPU hardware, the API is however not\n limited to GPUs or Intel specific hardware, as other hardware and manufacturers\n can also freely use this API for hardware accelerated video decoding.\n .\n This package provides the libva-wayland library.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdrm2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libva2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libva2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libwayland-client0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
