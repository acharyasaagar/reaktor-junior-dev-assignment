{"name":"gpg-agent","description":"GNU privacy guard - cryptographic agent\n GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.\n It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.\n It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant\n with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC4880.\n .\n This package contains the agent program gpg-agent which handles all\n secret key material for OpenPGP and S/MIME use.  The agent also\n provides a passphrase cache, which is used by pre-2.1 versions of\n GnuPG for OpenPGP operations.  Without this package, trying to do\n secret-key operations with any part of the modern GnuPG suite will\n fail.","dependencies":[{"name":"gpgconf","alternates":[]},{"name":"pinentry-curses","alternates":["pinentry"]},{"name":"libassuan0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcrypt20","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgpg-error0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnpth0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["gnupg-agent"]}
