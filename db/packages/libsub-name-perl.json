If package specification is\n omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return\n value is the sub.\n .\n The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).\n You won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To\n allow that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perlapi-5.26.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
