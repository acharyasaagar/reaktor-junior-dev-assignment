{"name":"libnpth0","description":"replacement for GNU Pth using system threads\n nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very\n similar to the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a\n replacement of GNU Pth for non-ancient operating systems. In\n contrast to GNU Pth it is based on the system's standard threads\n implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of libraries which are not\n compatible to GNU Pth.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
