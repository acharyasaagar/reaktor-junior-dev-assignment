{"name":"libsoxr0","description":"High quality 1D sample-rate conversion library\n The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional sample-rate\n conversion - it may be used, for example, to resample PCM-encoded audio.\n .\n It aims to give fast and high quality results for any constant (rational or\n irrational) resampling ratio. Phase-response, preserved bandwidth, aliasing,\n and rejection level parameters are all configurable; alternatively, simple\n `preset' configurations may be selected.\n .\n A simple API is provided that allows interfacing using commonly-used sample\n formats and buffering schemes.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgomp1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
