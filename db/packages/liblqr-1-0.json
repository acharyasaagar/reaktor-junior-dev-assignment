{"name":"liblqr-1-0","description":"converts plain array images into multi-size representation\n The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing\n non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.\n .\n The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts\n them to a multi-size representation.\n .\n Following is a list of features:\n .\n   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard\n   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done\n     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out\n     later without any further processing\n   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically\n     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in\n     successive steps without wasting computational time\n   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be\n     less connected, or more rigid, or both\n   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)\n   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process\n     as the parent image\n   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by\n     selecting among different energy gradient functions\n   * Reports progress through a customizable interface\n   * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors\n .\n The library implements the algorithm described in the paper \"Seam\n Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing\" by Shai Avidan and Ariel\n Shamir, which can be found at\n http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf\n .\n This package contains the shared library.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
