Unfortunately, this does not work on all\n systems, resulting in a black or corrupt display.  This package provides a\n blacklist of PCI IDs which fail.\n .\n We maintain this separately from GRUB because it is likely to be updated on\n a different schedule.","dependencies":[{"name":"grub-pc","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
