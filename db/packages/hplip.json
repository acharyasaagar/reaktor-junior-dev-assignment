{"name":"hplip","description":"HP Linux Printing and Imaging System (HPLIP)\n The HP Linux Printing and Imaging System provides full support for\n printing on most HP SFP (single function peripheral) inkjets and many\n LaserJets, and for scanning, sending faxes and for photo-card access on\n most HP MFP (multi-function peripheral) printers.\n .\n HPLIP is composed of:\n  * System services to handle communications with the printers\n  * HP CUPS backend driver (hp:) with bi-directional communication with\n    HP printers (provides printer status feedback to CUPS and enhanced\n    HPIJS functionality such as 4-side full-bleed printing support)\n  * HP CUPS backend driver for sending faxes (hpfax:)\n  * hpcups CUPS Raster driver to turn rasterized input from the CUPS\n    filter chain into the printer's native format (PCL, LIDIL, ...).\n    (hpcups is shipped in a separate package)\n  * HPIJS Ghostscript IJS driver to rasterize output from PostScript(tm)\n    files or from any other input format supported by Ghostscript, and\n    also for PostScript(tm) to fax conversion support\n    (HPIJS is shipped in a separate package)\n  * Command line utilities to perform printer maintenance, such as\n    ink-level monitoring or pen cleaning and calibration\n  * GUI and command line utility to download data from the photo card\n    interfaces in MFP devices\n  * GUI and command line utilities to interface with the fax functions\n  * A GUI toolbox to access all these functions in a friendly way\n  * HPAIO SANE backend (hpaio) for flatbed and Automatic Document Feeder\n    (ADF) scanning using MFP devices\n .\n USB, JetDirect (network) and parallel-port devices are supported.","dependencies":[{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]},{"name":"cups","alternates":[]},{"name":"hplip-data","alternates":[]},{"name":"libhpmud0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsane-hpaio","alternates":[]},{"name":"lsb-base","alternates":[]},{"name":"printer-driver-hpcups","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-dbus","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-gi","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-pexpect","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-pil","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3-reportlab","alternates":[]},{"name":"wget","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3","alternates":[]},{"name":"xz-utils","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcups2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdbus-1-3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsane1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
