{"name":"xfonts-scalable","description":"scalable fonts for X\n xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server\n or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to\n have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts\n available to X clients.\n .\n This package is missing three fonts from the X.Org source archives\n because the license terms on the fonts do not meet the Debian Free\n Software Guidelines; they are the Type1 fonts Adobe Utopia, IBM Courier,\n and Bigelow & Holmes (B&H) Luxi.\n .\n This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories\n for use by an X server or X font server.","dependencies":[{"name":"xfonts-utils","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
