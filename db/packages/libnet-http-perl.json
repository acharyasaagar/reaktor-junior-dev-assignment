{"name":"libnet-http-perl","description":"module providing low-level HTTP connection client\n The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client.  An instance of the\n Net::HTTP class represents a connection to an HTTP server.  The\n HTTP protocol is described in RFC 2616.  The Net::HTTP class\n supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. Net::HTTP is a sub-class of IO::Socket::INET.\n You can mix its methods with reading and writing from the socket directly.\n This is not necessarily a good idea, unless you know what you are doing.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perl","alternates":["libio-socket-ip-perl"]},{"name":"liburi-perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
