{"name":"libfont-afm-perl","description":"Font::AFM - Interface to Adobe Font Metrics files\n This module implements the Font::AFM class. Objects of this class are\n initialised from an AFM-file and allows you to obtain information\n about the font and the metrics of the various glyphs in the font.\n .\n All measurements in AFM files are given in terms of units equal to\n 1/1000 of the scale factor of the font being used. To compute actual\n sizes in a document, these amounts should be multiplied by (scale\n factor of font)/1000.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
