{"name":"libxcb-keysyms1","description":"utility libraries for X C Binding -- keysyms\n This package contains the library files needed to run software using\n libxcb-keysyms, providing standard X key constants and conversion to/from\n keycodes.\n .\n The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of\n libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension\n libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions\n and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the\n libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of\n the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxcb1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
