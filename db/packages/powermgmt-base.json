{"name":"powermgmt-base","description":"common utils for power management\n This package contains utilities for power management; beside certain\n mostly obsolete scripts, you'd want this package for \"on_ac_power\"\n which lets you determine whether the system is powered from battery\n or an abundant supply.  It's recommended to use this tool over a\n simple sysfs check, ConditionACPower or other ad-hoc methods which\n notoriously fail to account for unobvious quirks, both old and new.","dependencies":[],"reverseDependencies":[]}
