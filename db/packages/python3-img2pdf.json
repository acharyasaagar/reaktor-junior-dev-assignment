{"name":"python3-img2pdf","description":"Lossless conversion of raster images to PDF (library)\n This module will take a list of raster images and produce a PDF file with the\n images embedded in it. JPEG and JPEG2000 images will be included without\n recompression. Raster images in other formats will be included with zip/flate\n encoding which usually leads to an increase in the resulting size because\n formats like png compress better than PDF which just zip/flate compresses the\n RGB data. As a result, this module is able to losslessly wrap images into a\n PDF container with a quality to filesize ratio that is typically better (in\n case of JPEG and JPEG2000 images) or equal (in case of other formats) than\n that of existing tools.\n .\n Img2pdf includes its own PDF writer but will use the pdfrw module if\n available instead.\n .\n This package contains the Python library.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3-pil","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3:any","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
