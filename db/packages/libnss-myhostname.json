{"name":"libnss-myhostname","description":"nss module providing fallback resolution for the current hostname\n This package contains a plugin for the Name Service Switch, providing host\n name resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by\n gethostname(2). It returns all locally configured public IP addresses or -- if\n none are configured, the IPv4 address 127.0.1.1 (which is on the local\n loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).\n .\n A lot of software relies on that the local host name is resolvable. This\n package provides an alternative to the fragile and error-prone manual editing\n of /etc/hosts.\n .\n Installing this package automatically adds myhostname to /etc/nsswitch.conf.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["systemd"]}
