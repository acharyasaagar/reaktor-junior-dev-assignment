  "description": "high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities\n bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.\n It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available\n techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six\n times faster at decompression.\n .\n bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text\n compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally\n considerably better than that achieved by more conventional\n LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM\n family of statistical compressors.\n .\n The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its\n predecessor, bzip (.bz).",
