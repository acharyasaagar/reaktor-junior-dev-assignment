{"name":"libstemmer0d","description":"Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval\n Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a\n \"stemmed\" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common\n morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common\n linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines\n and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming\n enabled should be able to find a document containing \"cycling\" given the\n query \"cycles\".\n .\n Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.\n It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for\n English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the\n original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval\n researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
