A custom alsa-modules package can\n be built from the sources in the alsa-source package\n using the m-a utility (included in the module-assistant\n package). Please read the README.Debian file for more\n information about loading and building modules.\n .\n ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.","dependencies":[{"name":"kmod","alternates":[]},{"name":"linux-sound-base","alternates":[]},{"name":"udev","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[],"notes":["hello note"]}
