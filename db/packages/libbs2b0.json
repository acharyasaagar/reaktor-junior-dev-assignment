{"name":"libbs2b0","description":"Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP library\n The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve\n headphone listening of stereo audio records.\n .\n Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.\n What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel\n to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance\n traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing\n effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be\n somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b\n implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings\n for headphone listening.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
