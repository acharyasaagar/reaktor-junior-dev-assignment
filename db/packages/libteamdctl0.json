{"name":"libteamdctl0","description":"library for communication with `teamd` process\n libteamdctl is a library for communication with teamd process\n (via D-Bus, Unix socket or zeromq). It is used by the `teamdctl` utility.\n .\n Libteam provides a mechanism to team multiple NICs (ports) at OSI Layer 2\n (Data link) into a single virtual NIC. The process is called \"channel\n bonding\", \"Ethernet bonding\", \"channel teaming\", \"link aggregation\", etc.\n This is already implemented in the Linux kernel by the bonding driver but\n unlike the bonding driver, libteam (user space) has the following\n additional features:\n  * load-balancing for LACP support\n  * NS/NA (IPV6) link monitoring\n  * port priorities and stickiness (\"primary\" option enhancement)\n  * separate per-port link monitoring setup\n .\n Libteam requires Linux kernel 3.3 or higher.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdbus-1-3","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
