Applications using this library can do\n anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just\n about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means\n that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by\n installing new plug-ins.\n .\n This package contains shared GStreamer libraries from the \"good\" set. The API\n is not guaranteed to be stable.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgstreamer1.0-0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0"]}
