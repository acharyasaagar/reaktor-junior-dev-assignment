{"name":"make","description":"utility for directing compilation\n GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables\n and other target files of a program from the program's source\n files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program\n need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create\n them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)\n are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the\n corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building\n computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency\n solver.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
