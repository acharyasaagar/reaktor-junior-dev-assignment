{"name":"libblockdev2","description":"Library for manipulating block devices\n libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used\n for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,\n LUKS or MD RAID.\n .\n The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around\n its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as\n standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is\n stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no\n information about VGs when creating an LV).","dependencies":[{"name":"libblockdev-utils2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
