{"name":"gpgv","description":"GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool\n GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.\n .\n gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able\n to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg\n and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys\n used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration\n files and only a few options are implemented.","dependencies":[{"name":"libbz2-1.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcrypt20","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgpg-error0","alternates":[]},{"name":"zlib1g","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["gnupg2","gpgv2","python-debian"]}
