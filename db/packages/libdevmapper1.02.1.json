{"name":"libdevmapper1.02.1","description":"Linux Kernel Device Mapper userspace library\n The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management)\n Team's implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles\n volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout\n in user-space.  This makes it useful for not only LVM, but software raid,\n and other drivers that create \"virtual\" block devices.\n .\n This package contains the (user-space) shared library for accessing the\n device-mapper; it allows usage of the device-mapper through a clean,\n consistent interface (as opposed to through kernel ioctls).","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libselinux1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libudev1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["liblvm2app2.2","lvm2"]}
