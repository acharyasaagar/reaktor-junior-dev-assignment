{"name":"xdg-desktop-portal","description":"desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap\n xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,\n and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service\n is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated\n D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar\n desktop integration features.\n .\n The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require\n user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's\n requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,\n the portal implementation will open an \"Open\" dialog outside the sandbox,\n and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if\n that dialog is confirmed.\n .\n xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a\n desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk\n to provide its functionality.","dependencies":[{"name":"default-dbus-session-bus","alternates":["dbus-session-bus"]},{"name":"fuse","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfuse2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["flatpak"]}
