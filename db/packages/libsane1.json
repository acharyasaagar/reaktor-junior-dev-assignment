{"name":"libsane1","description":"API library for scanners\n SANE stands for \"Scanner Access Now Easy\" and is an application\n programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any\n raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,\n video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is\n free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The\n current source code is written to support several operating systems,\n including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available\n under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and\n backends are welcome, too, however).\n .\n This package includes the backends for many scanners. A libsane-extras\n package containing some not-yet-included backends is available separately.\n .\n Graphical frontends for sane are available in the packages sane and\n xsane. Command line frontend scanimage, saned and sane-find-scanner are\n available in the sane-utils package.","dependencies":[{"name":"acl","alternates":[]},{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsane-common","alternates":[]},{"name":"udev","alternates":["makedev"]},{"name":"libavahi-client3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libavahi-common3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgphoto2-6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgphoto2-port12","alternates":[]},{"name":"libieee1284-3","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjpeg8","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtiff5","alternates":[]},{"name":"libusb-1.0-0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
