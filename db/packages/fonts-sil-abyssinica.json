{"name":"fonts-sil-abyssinica","description":"smart Unicode font for Ethiopian and Erythrean scripts (Amharic et al.)\n The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of Ethiopia\n and Eritrea. Ethiopic (U+1200..U+137F) was added to Unicode 3.0. Ethiopic\n Supplement (U+1380..U+139F) and Ethiopic Extended (U+2D80..U+2DDF) were\n added to Unicode 4.1. Abyssinica SIL supports all Ethiopic characters which\n are in Unicode including the Unicode 4.1 extensions. Some languages of\n Ethiopia are not yet able to be fully represented in Unicode and, where\n necessary, non-Unicode characters were included in the Private Use Area.\n .\n Please read the documentation to see what ranges are supported\n and for more about the various features of the font.\n .\n Abyssinica SIL is a TrueType font with \"smart font\" capabilities added using\n the Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that\n complex typographic issues such as the placement of multiple diacritics or\n the formation of ligatures are handled by the font, provided you are\n running an application that provides an adequate level of support for one\n of these smart font technologies.\n .\n This release is a regular typeface, with no bold or italic version\n available or planned.\n .\n More font sources are available in the source package and on the\n project website. Webfont versions and examples are also available.","dependencies":[],"reverseDependencies":["ttf-sil-abyssinica"]}
