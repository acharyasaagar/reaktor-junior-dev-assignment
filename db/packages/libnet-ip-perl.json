{"name":"libnet-ip-perl","description":"Perl extension for manipulating IPv4/IPv6 addresses\n Net::IP provides functions to deal with IPv4/IPv6 addresses.\n The module can be used as a class, allowing the user to instantiate IP\n objects, which can be single IP addresses, prefixes, or ranges of addresses.\n There is also a procedural way of accessing most of the functions. Most\n subroutines can take either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses transparently.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
