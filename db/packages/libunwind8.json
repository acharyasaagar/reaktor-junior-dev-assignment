{"name":"libunwind8","description":"library to determine the call-chain of a program - runtime\n The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C\n programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.\n The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved\n (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any\n point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local\n (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API\n is useful in a number of applications.\n .\n This package includes the shared libraries","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"liblzma5","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
