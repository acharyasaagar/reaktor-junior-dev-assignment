{"name":"libfile-fcntllock-perl","description":"Perl module for file locking with fcntl(2)\n File::FcntlLock is a Perl module to do file locking in an object oriented\n fashion using the fcntl(2) system call. This allows locks on parts of a file\n as well as on the whole file and overcomes some known problems with flock(2),\n on which Perl's flock() function is based.\n .\n Furthermore due to its design it supports reliable locking over NFS.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perlapi-5.26.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
