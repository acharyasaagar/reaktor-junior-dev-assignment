{"name":"libcolamd2","description":"column approximate minimum degree ordering library for sparse matrices\n Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving\n sparse matrices.\n .\n The COLAMD library implements the \"COLumn Approximate Minimum Degree ordering\"\n algorithm. It computes a permutation vector P such that the LU factorization\n of A (:,P) tends to be sparser than that of A. The Cholesky factorization of\n (A (:,P))'*(A (:,P)) will also tend to be sparser than that of A'*A.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsuitesparseconfig5","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
