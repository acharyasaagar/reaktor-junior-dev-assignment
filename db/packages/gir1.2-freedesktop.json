This introspection\n data can be used in several different use cases, for example\n automatic code generation for bindings, API verification and documentation\n generation.\n .\n GObject Introspection contains tools to generate and handle the\n introspection data.\n .\n This package contains small pieces of introspection data for the Cairo,\n FontConfig, FreeType, GL, and some XOrg libraries. They are\n distributed in this package temporarily, while the original sources\n do not include support for GObject Introspection. They are far from\n complete and only include what is necessary for other introspection\n packages to work properly.","dependencies":[{"name":"gir1.2-glib-2.0","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
