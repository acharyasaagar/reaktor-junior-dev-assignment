{"name":"libiec61883-0","description":"partial implementation of IEC 61883 (shared lib)\n Implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug registers, and CMP), part 2\n (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6 (AMDTP). Outside of IIDC, nearly all\n FireWire multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols.\n .\n The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,\n MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and\n transmission. It uses the new \"rawiso\" API of libraw1394, which\n transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also\n represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for\n these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel\n modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug\n control registers and connection management that previously existed in\n experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libraw1394-11","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
