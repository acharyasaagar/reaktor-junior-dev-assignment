{"name":"vdpau-driver-all","description":"Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix (driver metapackage)\n VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) is an open source\n library (libvdpau) and API designed by NVIDIA originally for its GeForce\n 8 series and later GPU hardware, targeted at the X Window System on Unix\n operating-systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris). This VDPAU API\n allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process\n and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware.\n .\n This package depends on the full suite of drivers for the VDPAU API.\n It does not provide any drivers itself, and may be removed if you wish to\n only have certain drivers installed.","dependencies":[{"name":"mesa-vdpau-drivers","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
