{"name":"liblwp-protocol-https-perl","description":"HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent\n The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs\n with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so\n you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access\n sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.\n .\n If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and\n neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be\n the one provided by ca-certificates.\n .\n This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in\n v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN\n tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their\n dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what\n underlying modules to install.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"ca-certificates","alternates":[]},{"name":"libio-socket-ssl-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libnet-http-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libwww-perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libwww-perl"]}
