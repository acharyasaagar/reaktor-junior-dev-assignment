{"name":"libxml-sax-perl","description":"Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors\n XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and\n building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed\n around the need to be able to \"plug in\" different SAX parsers to an\n application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you\n familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs\n come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the\n javaness.\n .\n The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it\n is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a\n fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in\n libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.\n .\n The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called\n update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This\n script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to\n (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxml-namespacesupport-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libxml-sax-base-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"ucf","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
