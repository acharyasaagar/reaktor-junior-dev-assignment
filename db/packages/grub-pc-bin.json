{"name":"grub-pc-bin","description":"GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS binaries)\n GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a\n cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:\n .\n  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.\n  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.\n  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB\n    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking\n    update-grub.\n  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit\n    color set.\n  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu\n    entries.\n .\n This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with\n traditional PC/BIOS architecture.  It will not automatically install GRUB\n as the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg on\n upgrade, so most people should install grub-pc instead.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdevmapper1.02.1","alternates":[]},{"name":"grub-common","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
