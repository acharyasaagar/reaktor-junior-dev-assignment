{"name":"libnettle6","description":"low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)\n Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or\n less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,\n Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel\n space.\n .\n It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic\n algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a\n context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle\n doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the\n cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and\n in any way it needs.\n .\n This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic\n algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the\n asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
