{"name":"pinentry-gnome3","description":"GNOME 3 PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG\n This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or\n pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered\n information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.\n This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases\n when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using\n the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to\n particular software.\n .\n The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog\n designed for use with GNOME 3.  It tries to follow the GNOME Human\n Interface Guidelines as much as possible.  If the X Window System is\n not active then an alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There\n are sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs using other\n tool kits.","dependencies":[{"name":"gcr","alternates":[]},{"name":"libassuan0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgcr-base-3-1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libglib2.0-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgpg-error0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libncursesw5","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsecret-1-0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libtinfo5","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
