{"name":"xserver-xorg-video-ati-hwe-18.04","description":"X.Org X server -- AMD/ATI display driver wrapper\n This package provides the 'ati' driver for the AMD/ATI Mach64, Rage128,\n Radeon, FireGL, FireMV, FirePro and FireStream series. This driver is\n actually a wrapper that loads one of the 'mach64', 'r128' or 'radeon'\n sub-drivers depending on the hardware.\n These sub-drivers are brought through package dependencies.\n .\n Users of Rage, Mach, or Radeon boards may remove this package only if\n they use Driver \"r128\", \"mach64\", or \"radeon\" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n instead of relying on autodetection.\n .\n More information about X.Org can be found at:\n <URL:https://www.X.org>\n .\n This package is built from the X.org xf86-video-ati driver module.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libpciaccess0","alternates":[]},{"name":"xorg-video-abi-24","alternates":[]},{"name":"xserver-xorg-core-hwe-18.04","alternates":[]},{"name":"xserver-xorg-video-radeon-hwe-18.04","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
