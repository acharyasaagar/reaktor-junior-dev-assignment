{"name":"libvisual-0.4-0","description":"audio visualization framework\n Libvisual is a generic visualization framework that allows applications\n to easily access and manage visualization plugins.\n .\n Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that\n are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played by a media\n player. Most audio visualization is tied to a specific application or media\n player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications\n to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.\n .\n This package provides the runtime libraries for libvisual. Libvisual is not\n very useful without visualization plugins, so it is highly recommended to\n install the libvisual-0.4-plugins package.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libvisual-0.4-plugins"]}
