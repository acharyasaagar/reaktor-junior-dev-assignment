The Levenshtein\n edit distance is a measure of the degree of proximity between two strings.\n This distance is the number of substitutions, deletions or insertions\n (\"edits\") needed to transform one string into the other one (and vice versa).\n When two strings have distance 0, they are the same.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
