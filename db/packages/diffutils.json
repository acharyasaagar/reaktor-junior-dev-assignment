{"name":"diffutils","description":"File comparison utilities\n The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.\n .\n `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file\n in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where\n two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that\n differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences\n among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.\n .\n The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute\n updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.\n This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared\n to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can\n update, or \"patch\", a copy of the file.","dependencies":[],"reverseDependencies":[]}
