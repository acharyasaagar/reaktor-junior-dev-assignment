{"name":"gir1.2-soup-2.4","description":"GObject introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library\n This package contains introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library.\n .\n libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+\n applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers\n on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to\n the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also\n supported for those who want it).\n .\n It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate\n dynamic bindings.","dependencies":[{"name":"gir1.2-glib-2.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsoup-gnome2.4-1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libsoup2.4-1","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
