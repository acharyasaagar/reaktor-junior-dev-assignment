{"name":"foomatic-db-compressed-ppds","description":"OpenPrinting printer support - Compressed PPDs derived from the database\n Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up\n common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).\n It provides the \"glue\" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and\n your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files\n sent to the printer.\n .\n This package contains all PPD files which can be generated from the Foomatic\n database as one small compressed archive. This reduces the disk space\n consumption compared to the Foomatic XML database vastly and in addition\n makes listing of all available PPDs and extracting the needed PPD much faster\n than using the Foomatic XML database.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3","alternates":[]},{"name":"xz-utils","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["cups","foomatic-db"]}
