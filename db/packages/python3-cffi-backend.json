{"name":"python3-cffi-backend","description":"Foreign Function Interface for Python 3 calling C code - runtime\n Convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python 3.\n .\n The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling\n C code from Python. It keeps Python logic in Python, and minimises the C\n required. It is able to work at either the C API or ABI level, unlike most\n other approaches, that only support the ABI level.\n .\n This package contains the runtime support for pre-built cffi modules.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3:any","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libffi6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["python3-cffi"]}
