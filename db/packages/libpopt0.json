It can parse arbitrary\n argv[] style arrays and automatically set variables based on command\n line arguments. It also allows command line arguments to be aliased via\n configuration files and includes utility functions for parsing arbitrary\n strings into argv[] arrays using shell-like rules.\n .\n This package contains the runtime library and locale data.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
