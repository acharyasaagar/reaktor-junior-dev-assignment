The order is not affected when values\n corresponding to existing keys in the IxHash are changed. The elements can\n also be set to any arbitrary supplied order. The familiar perl array\n operations can also be performed on the IxHash.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
