{"name":"fontconfig","description":"generic font configuration library - support binaries\n Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which\n does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate\n fonts within the system and select them according to requirements\n specified by applications.\n .\n Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a\n particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific\n library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and\n rasterize fonts.\n .\n This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache\n (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program\n to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary\n cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma\n available to fontconfig applications.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfontconfig1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfreetype6","alternates":[]},{"name":"fontconfig-config","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
