{"name":"libpgm-5.2-0","description":"OpenPGM shared library\n OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast\n (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable\n and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,\n request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of\n unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the\n receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the\n sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram\n service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above\n switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.\n .\n This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
