{"name":"policykit-desktop-privileges","description":"run common desktop actions without password\n This package provides a set of PolicyKit privileges which allow Administrators\n to run common actions without being asked for their password:\n .\n  * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks)\n  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)\n  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through\n    KDE)\n  * Adding/changing system-wide NetworkManager connections\n  * Update already installed software\n  * Configure printers\n .\n It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the\n \"admin\" or \"sudo\" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use\n case where the user has full control over the hardware anyway.\n .\n This is implemented by shipping a pklocalauthority(8) file.","dependencies":[],"reverseDependencies":["gnome-settings-daemon"]}
