{"name":"libcgi-fast-perl","description":"CGI subclass for work with FCGI\n CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm. It is\n specialized to work with the FCGI module, which greatly speeds up CGI scripts\n by turning them into persistently running server processes. Scripts that\n perform time-consuming initialization processes, such as loading large\n modules or opening persistent database connections, will see large\n performance improvements.","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libcgi-pm-perl","alternates":[]},{"name":"libfcgi-perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["libcgi-pm-perl"]}
