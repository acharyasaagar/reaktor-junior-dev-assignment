{"name":"python3-speechd","description":"Python interface to Speech Dispatcher\n Speech Dispatcher provides a device independent layer for speech synthesis.\n It supports various software and hardware speech synthesizers as\n backends and provides a generic layer for synthesizing speech and\n playing back PCM data via those different backends to applications.\n .\n Various high level concepts like enqueueing vs. interrupting speech and\n application specific user configurations are implemented in a device\n independent way, therefore freeing the application programmer from\n having to yet again reinvent the wheel.\n .\n This package contains a Python library for communication with Speech\n Dispatcher.","dependencies":[{"name":"python3-xdg","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3:any","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["python-speechd"]}
