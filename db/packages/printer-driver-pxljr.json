{"name":"printer-driver-pxljr","description":"printer driver for HP Color LaserJet 35xx/36xx\n HP's Color LaserJets 35xx and 36xx are supported by HP's HPIJS driver\n (part of HPLIP), but HPIJS supports only the lowest quality level of\n the three which are available under Windows. This driver which is not\n developed at HP but by an independent developer, supports all modes and\n so provides the highest printout quality for these printers.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libijs-0.35","alternates":[]},{"name":"libjpeg8","alternates":[]},{"name":"python3","alternates":[]},{"name":"xz-utils","alternates":[]},{"name":"cups-filters","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":["pxljr"]}
