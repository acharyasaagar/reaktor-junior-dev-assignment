{"name":"liblzma5","description":"XZ-format compression library\n XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm\n compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful\n compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.\n .\n The native format of liblzma is XZ; it also supports raw (headerless)\n streams and the older LZMA format used by lzma. (For 7-Zip's related\n format, use the p7zip package instead.)","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
