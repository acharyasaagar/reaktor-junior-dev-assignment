{"name":"openssh-client","description":"secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines\n This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of\n the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working\n group.\n .\n Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine\n and for executing commands on a remote machine.\n It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted\n hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP\n ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.\n It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication\n channel.\n .\n This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent\n and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,\n and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.\n .\n In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all\n without a special permit.\n .\n ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are\n obsolete for most purposes.","dependencies":[{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]},{"name":"dpkg","alternates":[]},{"name":"passwd","alternates":[]},{"name":"libbsd0","alternates":[]},{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libedit2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libgssapi-krb5-2","alternates":[]},{"name":"libselinux1","alternates":[]},{"name":"libssl1.0.0","alternates":[]},{"name":"zlib1g","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
