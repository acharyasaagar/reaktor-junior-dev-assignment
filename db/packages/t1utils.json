{"name":"t1utils","description":"Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs\n The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB\n (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable\n form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format\n files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font\n file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a\n PFA or PFB font.\n .\n There are currently six programs:\n .\n  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.\n .\n  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.\n .\n  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,\n            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,\n            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...\n .\n  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from\n            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.\n .\n  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file\n            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside\n            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be\n            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex\n            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does\n            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1\n            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.\n .\n  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format\n            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,\n            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw\n            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to\n            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as\n            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need\n            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you\n            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils\n            will not help you create one.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
