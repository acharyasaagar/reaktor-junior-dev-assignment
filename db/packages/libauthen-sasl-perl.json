{"name":"libauthen-sasl-perl","description":"Authen::SASL - SASL Authentication framework\n SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network\n protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all\n protocols should be able to share.\n .\n The framework allows different implementations of the connection class\n to be plugged in. At the time of writing there were two such plugins:\n  - Authen::SASL::Perl\n    This module implements several mechanisms and is implemented\n    entirely in Perl.\n  - Authen::SASL::Cyrus\n    This module uses the Cyrus SASL C-library (both version 1 and 2 are\n    supported).","dependencies":[{"name":"perl","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
