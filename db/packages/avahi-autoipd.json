{"name":"avahi-autoipd","description":"Avahi IPv4LL network address configuration daemon\n Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.\n It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts\n running on a local network with no specific configuration. For\n example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to\n print to, files to look at and people to talk to.\n .\n This tool implements IPv4LL, \"Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local\n Addresses\" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address\n configuration from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the\n need for a central server. It is primarily intended to be used in\n ad-hoc networks which lack a DHCP server.","dependencies":[{"name":"libc6","alternates":[]},{"name":"libdaemon0","alternates":[]},{"name":"adduser","alternates":[]}],"reverseDependencies":[]}
